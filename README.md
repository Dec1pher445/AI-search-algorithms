# AI search algorithms
This is a python3 implementation of BFS and DFS search algorithms 

# The problem
The problem that the algorithms are tasked to solve is a simple parking managment problem. The logic is that there are
parking slots that are empty, parking slots that are full and waiting cars to get parked. The movement of the cars is done by a platoform which can be located 
at one potision and move one car at a time. Using bfs and dfs algorithms we can determine which is the sortest and most effecient way to park all the cars 
in the available parking slots.

#Usage
`python3 search_algorithm_front_queue.py` and then write the search method in full as it is displayed
